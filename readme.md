# Hydroxide

Next Generation High Performance Reactive JavaScript Framework.

Hydroxide is a **Reactive framework** that is designed to be Extremely Fast and Easy to Use.

It does not use a Virtual DOM and instead creates a dependency graph and surgically updates the DOM when state is updated. This means that your **component only needs to run once**.

Hydroxide's **Compiler** converts the JSX into Highly Optimized DOM manipulation code. Checkout the [Hydroxide Compiler Playground](https://hydroxide-compiler-playground.pages.dev/)

Hydroxide provides a first class support for **ergonomic complex state Management** out of the box.
